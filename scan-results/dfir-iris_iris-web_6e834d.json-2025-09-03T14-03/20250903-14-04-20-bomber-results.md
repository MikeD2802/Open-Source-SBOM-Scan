#### Vulnerabilities


Title: **[CVE-2025-24010] CWE-1385 CWE-346 CWE-350**<br>
Severity: **MODERATE**<br>

[Reference Documentation](https://ossindex.sonatype.org/vulnerability/CVE-2025-24010?component-type=npm&component-name=vite&utm_source=go-resty&utm_medium=integration&utm_content=2.15.2)

Vite is a frontend tooling framework for javascript. Vite allowed any websites to send any requests to the development server and read the response due to default CORS settings and lack of validation on the Origin header for WebSocket connections. This vulnerability is fixed in 6.0.9, 5.4.12, and 4.5.6.

<hr>


Title: **[CVE-2025-30208] CWE-200: Information Exposure**<br>
Severity: **MODERATE**<br>

[Reference Documentation](https://ossindex.sonatype.org/vulnerability/CVE-2025-30208?component-type=npm&component-name=vite&utm_source=go-resty&utm_medium=integration&utm_content=2.15.2)

Vite, a provider of frontend development tooling, has a vulnerability in versions prior to 6.2.3, 6.1.2, 6.0.12, 5.4.15, and 4.5.10. `@fs` denies access to files outside of Vite serving allow list. Adding `?raw??` or `?import&raw??` to the URL bypasses this limitation and returns the file content if it exists. This bypass exists because trailing separators such as `?` are removed in several places, but are not accounted for in query string regexes. The contents of arbitrary files can be returned to the browser. Only apps explicitly exposing the Vite dev server to the network (using `--host` or `server.host` config option) are affected. Versions 6.2.3, 6.1.2, 6.0.12, 5.4.15, and 4.5.10 fix the issue.

Title: **[CVE-2025-31486] CWE-200: Information Exposure**<br>
Severity: **MODERATE**<br>

[Reference Documentation](https://ossindex.sonatype.org/vulnerability/CVE-2025-31486?component-type=npm&component-name=vite&utm_source=go-resty&utm_medium=integration&utm_content=2.15.2)

Vite is a frontend tooling framework for javascript. The contents of arbitrary files can be returned to the browser. By adding ?.svg with ?.wasm?init or with sec-fetch-dest: script header, the server.fs.deny restriction was able to bypass. This bypass is only possible if the file is smaller than build.assetsInlineLimit (default: 4kB) and when using Vite 6.0+. Only apps explicitly exposing the Vite dev server to the network (using --host or server.host config option) are affected. This vulnerability is fixed in 4.5.12, 5.4.17, 6.0.14, 6.1.4, and 6.2.5.

<hr>


Title: **[CVE-2025-32395] CWE-200: Information Exposure**<br>
Severity: **HIGH**<br>

[Reference Documentation](https://ossindex.sonatype.org/vulnerability/CVE-2025-32395?component-type=npm&component-name=vite&utm_source=go-resty&utm_medium=integration&utm_content=2.15.2)

Vite is a frontend tooling framework for javascript. Prior to 6.2.6, 6.1.5, 6.0.15, 5.4.18, and 4.5.13, the contents of arbitrary files can be returned to the browser if the dev server is running on Node or Bun. HTTP 1.1 spec (RFC 9112) does not allow # in request-target. Although an attacker can send such a request. For those requests with an invalid request-line (it includes request-target), the spec recommends to reject them with 400 or 301. The same can be said for HTTP 2. On Node and Bun, those requests are not rejected internally and is passed to the user land. For those requests, the value of http.IncomingMessage.url contains #. Vite assumed req.url won't contain # when checking server.fs.deny, allowing those kinds of requests to bypass the check. Only apps explicitly exposing the Vite dev server to the network (using --host or server.host config option) and running the Vite dev server on runtimes that are not Deno (e.g. Node, Bun) are affected. This vulnerability is fixed in 6.2.6, 6.1.5, 6.0.15, 5.4.18, and 4.5.13.

Title: **[CVE-2025-46565] CWE-22: Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')**<br>
Severity: **MODERATE**<br>

[Reference Documentation](https://ossindex.sonatype.org/vulnerability/CVE-2025-46565?component-type=npm&component-name=vite&utm_source=go-resty&utm_medium=integration&utm_content=2.15.2)

Vite is a frontend tooling framework for javascript. Prior to versions 6.3.4, 6.2.7, 6.1.6, 5.4.19, and 4.5.14, the contents of files in the project root that are denied by a file matching pattern can be returned to the browser. Only apps explicitly exposing the Vite dev server to the network (using --host or server.host config option) are affected. Only files that are under project root and are denied by a file matching pattern can be bypassed. `server.fs.deny` can contain patterns matching against files (by default it includes .env, .env.*, *.{crt,pem} as such patterns). These patterns were able to bypass for files under `root` by using a combination of slash and dot (/.). This issue has been patched in versions 6.3.4, 6.2.7, 6.1.6, 5.4.19, and 4.5.14.

### pkg:npm/brace-expansion@2.0.1
Brace expansion as known from sh/bash
#### Vulnerabilities


Title: **[CVE-2025-5889] CWE-1333 CWE-400**<br>
Severity: **MODERATE**<br>

### pkg:pypi/flask-caching@2.3.0

#### Vulnerabilities


Title: **[CVE-2021-33026] CWE-502: Deserialization of Untrusted Data**<br>
Severity: **CRITICAL**<br>

[Reference Documentation](https://ossindex.sonatype.org/vulnerability/CVE-2021-33026?component-type=pypi&component-name=flask-caching&utm_source=go-resty&utm_medium=integration&utm_content=2.15.2)

The Flask-Caching extension through 1.10.1 for Flask relies on Pickle for serialization, which may lead to remote code execution or local privilege escalation. If an attacker gains access to cache storage (e.g., filesystem, Memcached, Redis, etc.), they can construct a crafted payload, poison the cache, and execute Python code. NOTE: a third party indicates that exploitation is extremely unlikely unless the machine is already compromised; in other cases, the attacker would be unable to write their payload to the cache and generate the required collision

Sonatype's research suggests that this CVE's details differ from those defined at NVD. See https://ossindex.sonatype.org/vulnerability/CVE-2021-33026 for details

### pkg:pypi/flask-cors@5.0.0

#### Vulnerabilities


Title: **[CVE-2024-6839] CWE-41: Improper Resolution of Path Equivalence**<br>
Severity: **MODERATE**<br>

[Reference Documentation](https://ossindex.sonatype.org/vulnerability/CVE-2024-6839?component-type=pypi&component-name=flask-cors&utm_source=go-resty&utm_medium=integration&utm_content=2.15.2)

corydolphin/flask-cors version 4.0.1 contains an improper regex path matching vulnerability. The plugin prioritizes longer regex patterns over more specific ones when matching paths, which can lead to less restrictive CORS policies being applied to sensitive endpoints. This mismatch in regex pattern priority allows unauthorized cross-origin access to sensitive data or functionality, potentially exposing confidential information and increasing the risk of unauthorized actions by malicious actors.

<hr>


Title: **[CVE-2024-6844] CWE-840**<br>
Severity: **MODERATE**<br>

[Reference Documentation](https://ossindex.sonatype.org/vulnerability/CVE-2024-6844?component-type=pypi&component-name=flask-cors&utm_source=go-resty&utm_medium=integration&utm_content=2.15.2)

A vulnerability in corydolphin/flask-cors version 4.0.1 allows for inconsistent CORS matching due to the handling of the '+' character in URL paths. The request.path is passed through the unquote_plus function, which converts the '+' character to a space ' '. This behavior leads to incorrect path normalization, causing potential mismatches in CORS configuration. As a result, endpoints may not be matched correctly to their CORS settings, leading to unexpected CORS policy application. This can cause unauthorized cross-origin access or block valid requests, creating security vulnerabilities and usability issues.

<hr>


Title: **[CVE-2024-6866] CWE-178: Improper Handling of Case Sensitivity**<br>
Severity: **HIGH**<br>

[Reference Documentation](https://ossindex.sonatype.org/vulnerability/CVE-2024-6866?component-type=pypi&component-name=flask-cors&utm_source=go-resty&utm_medium=integration&utm_content=2.15.2)

corydolphin/flask-cors version 4.01 contains a vulnerability where the request path matching is case-insensitive due to the use of the `try_match` function, which is originally intended for matching hosts. This results in a mismatch because paths in URLs are case-sensitive, but the regex matching treats them as case-insensitive. This misconfiguration can lead to significant security vulnerabilities, allowing unauthorized origins to access paths meant to be restricted, resulting in data exposure and potential data leaks.

<hr>




### pkg:pypi/flask@3.1.0

#### Vulnerabilities


Title: **[CVE-2025-47278] CWE-683: Function Call With Incorrect Order of Arguments**<br>
Severity: **LOW**<br>

[Reference Documentation](https://ossindex.sonatype.org/vulnerability/CVE-2025-47278?component-type=pypi&component-name=flask&utm_source=go-resty&utm_medium=integration&utm_content=2.15.2)

Flask is a web server gateway interface (WSGI) web application framework. In Flask 3.1.0, the way fallback key configuration was handled resulted in the last fallback key being used for signing, rather than the current signing key. Signing is provided by the `itsdangerous` library. A list of keys can be passed, and it expects the last (top) key in the list to be the most recent key, and uses that for signing. Flask was incorrectly constructing that list in reverse, passing the signing key first. Sites that have opted-in to use key rotation by setting `SECRET_KEY_FALLBACKS` care likely to unexpectedly be signing their sessions with stale keys, and their transition to fresher keys will be impeded. Sessions are still signed, so this would not cause any sort of data integrity loss. Version 3.1.1 contains a patch for the issue.
