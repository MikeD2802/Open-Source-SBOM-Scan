## Vulnerability Details


### pkg:pypi/pandas@2.3.0
Powerful data structures for data analysis, time series,and statistics
#### Vulnerabilities


Title: **[CVE-2020-13091] CWE-502: Deserialization of Untrusted Data**<br>
Severity: **CRITICAL**<br>

[Reference Documentation](https://ossindex.sonatype.org/vulnerability/CVE-2020-13091?component-type=pypi&component-name=pandas&utm_source=go-resty&utm_medium=integration&utm_content=2.15.2)

pandas through 1.0.3 can unserialize and execute commands from an untrusted file that is passed to the read_pickle() function, if __reduce__ makes an os.system call. NOTE: third parties dispute this issue because the read_pickle() function is documented as unsafe and it is the user's responsibility to use the function in a secure manner

### pkg:pypi/joblib@1.5.1
Lightweight pipelining: using Python functions as pipeline jobs.
#### Vulnerabilities


Title: **[CVE-2024-34997] CWE-502: Deserialization of Untrusted Data**<br>
Severity: **CRITICAL**<br>

[Reference Documentation](https://ossindex.sonatype.org/vulnerability/CVE-2024-34997?component-type=pypi&component-name=joblib&utm_source=go-resty&utm_medium=integration&utm_content=2.15.2)

### pkg:pypi/transformers@4.52.4
Experimental module for AST transformations.
#### Vulnerabilities


Title: **[CVE-2025-2099] CWE-1333**<br>
Severity: **HIGH**<br>

[Reference Documentation](https://ossindex.sonatype.org/vulnerability/CVE-2025-2099?component-type=pypi&component-name=transformers&utm_source=go-resty&utm_medium=integration&utm_content=2.15.2)

A vulnerability in the `preprocess_string()` function of the `transformers.testing_utils` module in huggingface/transformers version v4.48.3 allows for a Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) attack. The regular expression used to process code blocks in docstrings contains nested quantifiers, leading to exponential backtracking when processing input with a large number of newline characters. An attacker can exploit this by providing a specially crafted payload, causing high CPU usage and potential application downtime, effectively resulting in a Denial of Service (DoS) scenario.

### pkg:pypi/pip@25.1.1
The PyPA recommended tool for installing Python packages.
#### Vulnerabilities


Title: **[CVE-2018-20225] CWE-20: Improper Input Validation**<br>
Severity: **HIGH**<br>

[Reference Documentation](https://ossindex.sonatype.org/vulnerability/CVE-2018-20225?component-type=pypi&component-name=pip&utm_source=go-resty&utm_medium=integration&utm_content=2.15.2)

An issue was discovered in pip (all versions) because it installs the version with the highest version number, even if the user had intended to obtain a private package from a private index. This only affects use of the --extra-index-url option, and exploitation requires that the package does not already exist in the public index (and thus the attacker can put the package there with an arbitrary version number). NOTE: it has been reported that this is intended functionality and the user is responsible for using --extra-index-url securely
