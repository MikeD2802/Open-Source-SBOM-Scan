Title: **[CVE-2024-29025] CWE-770: Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling**<br>
Severity: **MODERATE**<br>

[Reference Documentation](https://ossindex.sonatype.org/vulnerability/CVE-2024-29025?component-type=maven&component-name=io.netty%2Fnetty-codec-http&utm_source=go-resty&utm_medium=integration&utm_content=2.15.2)

Netty is an asynchronous event-driven network application framework for rapid development of maintainable high performance protocol servers & clients. The `HttpPostRequestDecoder` can be tricked to accumulate data. While the decoder can store items on the disk if configured so, there are no limits to the number of fields the form can have, an attacher can send a chunked post consisting of many small fields that will be accumulated in the `bodyListHttpData` list. The decoder cumulates bytes in the `undecodedChunk` buffer until it can decode a field, this field can cumulate data without limits. This vulnerability is fixed in 4.1.108.Final.

Title: **[CVE-2023-25194] CWE-502: Deserialization of Untrusted Data**<br>
Severity: **HIGH**<br>

[Reference Documentation](https://ossindex.sonatype.org/vulnerability/CVE-2023-25194?component-type=maven&component-name=org.apache.kafka%2Fkafka-clients&utm_source=go-resty&utm_medium=integration&utm_content=2.15.2)

A possible security vulnerability has been identified in Apache Kafka Connect API.
This requires access to a Kafka Connect worker, and the ability to create/modify connectors on it with an arbitrary Kafka client SASL JAAS config
and a SASL-based security protocol, which has been possible on Kafka Connect clusters since Apache Kafka Connect 2.3.0.
When configuring the connector via the Kafka Connect REST API, anÂ authenticated operatorÂ can set the `sasl.jaas.config`
property for any of the connector's Kafka clientsÂ to "com.sun.security.auth.module.JndiLoginModule", which can be done via the
`producer.override.sasl.jaas.config`, `consumer.override.sasl.jaas.config`, or `admin.override.sasl.jaas.config` properties.
This will allow the server to connect to the attacker's LDAP server
and deserialize the LDAP response, which the attacker can use to execute java deserialization gadget chains on the Kafka connect server.
Attacker can cause unrestricted deserialization of untrusted data (or)Â RCE vulnerability when there are gadgets in the classpath.

Since Apache Kafka 3.0.0, users are allowed to specify these properties in connector configurations for Kafka Connect clusters running with out-of-the-box
configurations. Before Apache Kafka 3.0.0, users may not specify these properties unless the Kafka Connect cluster has been reconfigured with a connector
client override policy that permits them.

Since Apache Kafka 3.4.0, we have added a system property ("-Dorg.apache.kafka.disallowed.login.modules") to disable the problematic login modules usage
in SASL JAAS configuration. Also by default "com.sun.security.auth.module.JndiLoginModule" is disabled in Apache Kafka Connect 3.4.0. 

We advise the Kafka Connect users to validate connector configurations and only allow trusted JNDI configurations. Also examine connector dependencies for 
vulnerable versions and either upgrade their connectors, upgrading that specific dependency, or removing the connectors as options for remediation. Finally,
in addition to leveraging the "org.apache.kafka.disallowed.login.modules" system property, Kafka Connect users can also implement their own connector
client config override policy, which can be used to control which Kafka client properties can be overridden directly in a connector config and which cannot.

[Reference Documentation](https://ossindex.sonatype.org/vulnerability/CVE-2024-56128?component-type=maven&component-name=org.apache.kafka%2Fkafka-clients&utm_source=go-resty&utm_medium=integration&utm_content=2.15.2)

Incorrect Implementation of Authentication Algorithm in Apache Kafka's SCRAM implementation.

Issue Summary:
Apache Kafka's implementation of the Salted Challenge Response Authentication Mechanism (SCRAM) did not fully adhere to the requirements of RFC 5802 [1].
Specifically, as per RFC 5802, the server must verify that the nonce sent by the client in the second message matches the nonce sent by the server in its first message.
However, Kafka's SCRAM implementation did not perform this validation.

Impact:
This vulnerability is exploitable only when an attacker has plaintext access to the SCRAM authentication exchange. However, the usage of SCRAM over plaintext is strongly
discouraged as it is considered an insecure practice [2]. Apache Kafka recommends deploying SCRAM exclusively with TLS encryption to protect SCRAM exchanges from interception [3].
Deployments using SCRAM with TLS are not affected by this issue.

How to Detect If You Are Impacted:
If your deployment uses SCRAM authentication over plaintext communication channels (without TLS encryption), you are likely impacted.
To check if TLS is enabled, review your server.properties configuration file for listeners property. If you have SASL_PLAINTEXT in the listeners, then you are likely impacted.

Fix Details:
The issue has been addressed by introducing nonce verification in the final message of the SCRAM authentication exchange to ensure compliance with RFC 5802.

Affected Versions:
Apache Kafka versions 0.10.2.0 through 3.9.0, excluding the fixed versions below.

Fixed Versions:
3.9.0
3.8.1
3.7.2

Users are advised to upgrade to 3.7.2 or later to mitigate this issue.

Recommendations for Mitigation:
Users unable to upgrade to the fixed versions can mitigate the issue by:
- Using TLS with SCRAM Authentication:
Always deploy SCRAM over TLS to encrypt authentication exchanges and protect against interception.
- Considering Alternative Authentication Mechanisms:
Evaluate alternative authentication mechanisms, such as PLAIN, Kerberos or OAuth with TLS, which provide additional layers of security.

### pkg:maven/org.xerial.snappy/snappy-java@1.1.4
snappy-java: A fast compression/decompression library
#### Vulnerabilities


Title: **[CVE-2023-34453] CWE-190: Integer Overflow or Wraparound**<br>
Severity: **HIGH**<br>

[Reference Documentation](https://ossindex.sonatype.org/vulnerability/CVE-2023-34453?component-type=maven&component-name=org.xerial.snappy%2Fsnappy-java&utm_source=go-resty&utm_medium=integration&utm_content=2.15.2)

snappy-java is a fast compressor/decompressor for Java. Due to unchecked multiplications, an integer overflow may occur in versions prior to 1.1.10.1, causing a fatal error.

The function `shuffle(int[] input)` in the file `BitShuffle.java` receives an array of integers and applies a bit shuffle on it. It does so by multiplying the length by 4 and passing it to the natively compiled shuffle function. Since the length is not tested, the multiplication by four can cause an integer overflow and become a smaller value than the true size, or even zero or negative. In the case of a negative value, a `java.lang.NegativeArraySizeException` exception will raise, which can crash the program. In a case of a value that is zero or too small, the code that afterwards references the shuffled array will assume a bigger size of the array, which might cause exceptions such as `java.lang.ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`.

The same issue exists also when using the `shuffle` functions that receive a double, float, long and short, each using a different multiplier that may cause the same issue.

Version 1.1.10.1 contains a patch for this vulnerability.

Severity: **HIGH**<br>

[Reference Documentation](https://ossindex.sonatype.org/vulnerability/CVE-2023-34454?component-type=maven&component-name=org.xerial.snappy%2Fsnappy-java&utm_source=go-resty&utm_medium=integration&utm_content=2.15.2)

snappy-java is a fast compressor/decompressor for Java. Due to unchecked multiplications, an integer overflow may occur in versions prior to 1.1.10.1, causing an unrecoverable fatal error.

The function `compress(char[] input)` in the file `Snappy.java` receives an array of characters and compresses it. It does so by multiplying the length by 2 and passing it to the rawCompress` function.

Since the length is not tested, the multiplication by two can cause an integer overflow and become negative. The rawCompress function then uses the received length and passes it to the natively compiled maxCompressedLength function, using the returned value to allocate a byte array.

Since the maxCompressedLength function treats the length as an unsigned integer, it doesnât care that it is negative, and it returns a valid value, which is casted to a signed integer by the Java engine. If the result is negative, a `java.lang.NegativeArraySizeException` exception will be raised while trying to allocate the array `buf`. On the other side, if the result is positive, the `buf` array will successfully be allocated, but its size might be too small to use for the compression, causing a fatal Access Violation error.

The same issue exists also when using the `compress` functions that receive double, float, int, long and short, each using a different multiplier that may cause the same issue. The issue most likely wonât occur when using a byte array, since creating a byte array of size 0x80000000 (or any other negative value) is impossible in the first place.

Version 1.1.10.1 contains a patch for this issue.

snappy-java is a fast compressor/decompressor for Java. Due to use of an unchecked chunk length, an unrecoverable fatal error can occur in versions prior to 1.1.10.1.

The code in the function hasNextChunk in the fileSnappyInputStream.java checks if a given stream has more chunks to read. It does that by attempting to read 4 bytes. If it wasnât possible to read the 4 bytes, the function returns false. Otherwise, if 4 bytes were available, the code treats them as the length of the next chunk.

In the case that the `compressed` variable is null, a byte array is allocated with the size given by the input data. Since the code doesnât test the legality of the `chunkSize` variable, it is possible to pass a negative number (such as 0xFFFFFFFF which is -1), which will cause the code to raise a `java.lang.NegativeArraySizeException` exception. A worse case would happen when passing a huge positive value (such as 0x7FFFFFFF), which would raise the fatal `java.lang.OutOfMemoryError` error.

Version 1.1.10.1 contains a patch for this issue.

The NPM package `micromatch` prior to 4.0.8 is vulnerable to Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS). The vulnerability occurs in `micromatch.braces()` in `index.js` because the pattern `.*` will greedily match anything. By passing a malicious payload, the pattern matching will keep backtracking to the input while it doesn't find the closing bracket. As the input size increases, the consumption time will also increase until it causes the application to hang or slow down. There was a merged fix but further testing shows the issue persists. This issue should be mitigated by using a safe pattern that won't start backtracking the regular expression due to greedy matching. This issue was fixed in version 4.0.8.

node-fetch before versions 2.6.1 and 3.0.0-beta.9 did not honor the size option after following a redirect, which means that when a content size was over the limit, a FetchError would never get thrown and the process would end without failure. For most people, this fix will have a little or no impact. However, if you are relying on node-fetch to gate files above a size, the impact could be significant, for example: If you don't double-check the size of the data after fetch() has completed, your JS thread could get tied up doing work on a large file (DoS) and/or cost you money in computing.

xmldom is a pure JavaScript W3C standard-based (XML DOM Level 2 Core) `DOMParser` and `XMLSerializer` module. xmldom parses XML that is not well-formed because it contains multiple top level elements, and adds all root nodes to the `childNodes` collection of the `Document`, without reporting any error or throwing.

### pkg:npm/braces@1.8.5
Bash-like brace expansion, implemented in JavaScript. Safer than other brace expansion libs, with complete support for the Bash 4.3 braces specification, without sacrificing speed.
#### Vulnerabilities


Title: **[CVE-2024-4068] CWE-1050 CWE-400**<br>
Severity: **HIGH**<br>

[Reference Documentation](https://ossindex.sonatype.org/vulnerability/CVE-2024-4068?component-type=npm&component-name=braces&utm_source=go-resty&utm_medium=integration&utm_content=2.15.2)

The NPM package `braces`, versions prior to 3.0.3, fails to limit the number of characters it can handle, which could lead to Memory Exhaustion. In `lib/parse.js,` if a malicious user sends "imbalanced braces" as input, the parsing will enter a loop, which will cause the program to start allocating heap memory without freeing it at any moment of the loop. Eventually, the JavaScript heap limit is reached, and the program will crash.

<hr>




### pkg:npm/cookie@0.4.2
HTTP server cookie parsing and serialization
#### Vulnerabilities


Title: **[CVE-2024-47764] CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')**<br>
Severity: **MODERATE**<br>

[Reference Documentation](https://ossindex.sonatype.org/vulnerability/CVE-2024-47764?component-type=npm&component-name=cookie&utm_source=go-resty&utm_medium=integration&utm_content=2.15.2)

cookie is a basic HTTP cookie parser and serializer for HTTP servers. The cookie name could be used to set other fields of the cookie, resulting in an unexpected cookie value. A similar escape can be used for path and domain, which could be abused to alter other fields of the cookie. Upgrade to 0.7.0, which updates the validation for name, path, and domain.

<hr>




### pkg:npm/trim-newlines@1.0.0
Trim newlines from the start and/or end of a string
#### Vulnerabilities


Title: **[CVE-2021-33623] CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption ('Resource Exhaustion')**<br>
Severity: **HIGH**<br>

[Reference Documentation](https://ossindex.sonatype.org/vulnerability/CVE-2021-33623?component-type=npm&component-name=trim-newlines&utm_source=go-resty&utm_medium=integration&utm_content=2.15.2)

The trim-newlines package before 3.0.1 and 4.x before 4.0.1 for Node.js has an issue related to regular expression denial-of-service (ReDoS) for the .end() method.

<hr>




### pkg:npm/lodash.template@4.5.0
The Lodash method `_.template` exported as a module.
#### Vulnerabilities


Title: **[CVE-2021-23337] CWE-94: Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection')**<br>
Severity: **HIGH**<br>

[Reference Documentation](https://ossindex.sonatype.org/vulnerability/CVE-2021-23337?component-type=npm&component-name=lodash.template&utm_source=go-resty&utm_medium=integration&utm_content=2.15.2)

Lodash versions prior to 4.17.21 are vulnerable to Command Injection via the template function.

<hr>




### pkg:npm/ajv@5.5.2
Another JSON Schema Validator
#### Vulnerabilities


Title: **[CVE-2020-15366] CWE-1321**<br>
Severity: **MODERATE**<br>

[Reference Documentation](https://ossindex.sonatype.org/vulnerability/CVE-2020-15366?component-type=npm&component-name=ajv&utm_source=go-resty&utm_medium=integration&utm_content=2.15.2)

An issue was discovered in ajv.validate() in Ajv (aka Another JSON Schema Validator) 6.12.2. A carefully crafted JSON schema could be provided that allows execution of other code by prototype pollution. (While untrusted schemas are recommended against, the worst case of an untrusted schema should be a denial of service, not execution of code.)

Sonatype's research suggests that this CVE's details differ from those defined at NVD. See https://ossindex.sonatype.org/vulnerability/CVE-2020-15366 for details

### pkg:npm/babel-traverse@6.26.0
The Babel Traverse module maintains the overall tree state, and is responsible for replacing, removing, and adding nodes
#### Vulnerabilities


Title: **[CVE-2023-45133] CWE-184: Incomplete Blacklist**<br>
Severity: **HIGH**<br>

[Reference Documentation](https://ossindex.sonatype.org/vulnerability/CVE-2023-45133?component-type=npm&component-name=babel-traverse&utm_source=go-resty&utm_medium=integration&utm_content=2.15.2)

Babel is a compiler for writingJavaScript. In `@babel/traverse` prior to versions 7.23.2 and 8.0.0-alpha.4 and all versions of `babel-traverse`, using Babel to compile code that was specifically crafted by an attacker can lead to arbitrary code execution during compilation, when using plugins that rely on the `path.evaluate()`or `path.evaluateTruthy()` internal Babel methods. Known affected plugins are `@babel/plugin-transform-runtime`; `@babel/preset-env` when using its `useBuiltIns` option; and any "polyfill provider" plugin that depends on `@babel/helper-define-polyfill-provider`, such as `babel-plugin-polyfill-corejs3`, `babel-plugin-polyfill-corejs2`, `babel-plugin-polyfill-es-shims`, `babel-plugin-polyfill-regenerator`. No other plugins under the `@babel/` namespace are impacted, but third-party plugins might be. Users that only compile trusted code are not impacted. The vulnerability has been fixed in `@babel/traverse@7.23.2` and `@babel/traverse@8.0.0-alpha.4`. Those who cannot upgrade `@babel/traverse` and are using one of the affected packages mentioned above should upgrade them to their latest version to avoid triggering the vulnerable code path in affected `@babel/traverse` versions: `@babel/plugin-transform-runtime` v7.23.2, `@babel/preset-env` v7.23.2, `@babel/helper-define-polyfill-provider` v0.4.3, `babel-plugin-polyfill-corejs2` v0.4.6, `babel-plugin-polyfill-corejs3` v0.8.5, `babel-plugin-polyfill-es-shims` v0.10.0, `babel-plugin-polyfill-regenerator` v0.5.3.
