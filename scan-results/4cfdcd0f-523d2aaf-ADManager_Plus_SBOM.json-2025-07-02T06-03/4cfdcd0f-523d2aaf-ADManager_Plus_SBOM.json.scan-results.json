The `parse` method of the JSON5 library before and including versions 1.0.1 and 2.2.1 does not restrict parsing of keys named `__proto__`, allowing specially crafted strings to pollute the prototype of the resulting object. This vulnerability pollutes the prototype of the object returned by `JSON5.parse` and not the global Object prototype, which is the commonly understood definition of Prototype Pollution. However, polluting the prototype of a single object can have significant security impact for an application if the object is later used in trusted operations. This vulnerability could allow an attacker to set arbitrary and unexpected keys on the object returned from `JSON5.parse`. The actual impact will depend on how applications utilize the returned object and how they filter unwanted keys, but could include denial of service, cross-site scripting, elevation of privilege, and in extreme cases, remote code execution. `JSON5.parse` should restrict parsing of `__proto__` keys when parsing JSON strings to objects. As a point of reference, the `JSON.parse` method included in JavaScript ignores `__proto__` keys. Simply changing `JSON5.parse` to `JSON.parse` in the examples above mitigates this vulnerability. This vulnerability is patched in json5 versions 1.0.2, 2.2.2, and later.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":8.8,"exploitabilityScore":2.9,"impactScore":5.9},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"security-advisories@github.com","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:L/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":7.1,"exploitabilityScore":1.7,"impactScore":5.5},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2022-46175","epss":0.4532,"percentile":0.97467,"date":"2025-07-01"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-direct-match","matcher":"javascript-matcher","searchedBy":{"language":"javascript","namespace":"github:language:javascript","package":{"name":"json5","version":"0.5.1"}},"found":{"versionConstraint":"<1.0.2

Due to unchecked multiplications, an integer overflow may occur in versions prior to 1.1.10.1, causing a fatal error.\n\nThe function `shuffle(int[] input)` in the file `BitShuffle.java` receives an array of integers and applies a bit shuffle on it. It does so by multiplying the length by 4 and passing it to the natively compiled shuffle function. Since the length is not tested, the multiplication by four can cause an integer overflow and become a smaller value than the true size, or even zero or negative. In the case of a negative value, a `java.lang.NegativeArraySizeException` exception will raise, which can crash the program. In a case of a value that is zero or too small, the code that afterwards references the shuffled array will assume a bigger size of the array, which might cause exceptions such as `java.lang.ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`.\n\nThe same issue exists also when using the `shuffle` functions that receive a double, float, long and short, each using a different multiplier that may cause the same issue.\n\nVersion 1.1.10.1 contains a patch for this vulnerability.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":7.5,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"security-advisories@github.com","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":5.9,"exploitabilityScore":2.3,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2023-34453","epss":0.00588,"percentile":0.68274,"date":"2025-07-01"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-direct-match","matcher":"java-matcher","searchedBy":{"language":"java","namespace":"github:language:java","package":{"name":"snappy-java","version":"1.1.4"}},"found":{"versionConstraint":"<=1.1.10.0 (unknown)","vulnerabilityID":"GHSA-pqr6-cmr2-h8hf"},"fix":{"suggestedVersion":"1.1.10.1"}}],"artifact":{"id":"ManageEngine_ADManager_Plus_Common/AdventNet/ADManagerPlus/ES/plugins/search-guard-6/snappy-java-1.1.4.jar","name":"snappy-java","version":"1.1.4","type":"java-archive","locations":null,"language":"java","licenses":["The Apache Software License, Version 2.0"],"cpes":[],"purl":"pkg:maven/org.xerial.snappy/snappy-java@1.1.4","upstreams":[],"metadataType":"JavaMetadata","metadata":{"virtualPath":"","pomArtifactID":"snappy-java","pomGroupID":"org.xerial.snappy","manifestName":"","archiveDigests":null}}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"GHSA-c4r9-r8fh-9vj2","dataSource":"https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-c4r9-r8fh-9vj2","namespace":"github:language:java","severity":"Medium","urls":[],"description":"snakeYAML before 1.31 vulnerable to Denial of Service due to Out-of-bounds Write","cvss":[{"type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":6.5,"exploitabilityScore":2.9,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2022-38749","epss":0.00543,"percentile":0.66873,"date":"2025-07-01"}],"fix":{"versions":["1.31"],"state":"fixed"},"advisories":[],"risk":0.312225},"relatedVulnerabilities":[{"id":"CVE-2022-38749","dataSource":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-38749","namespace":"nvd:cpe","severity":"Medium","urls":["https://bitbucket.org/snakeyaml/snakeyaml/issues/525/got-stackoverflowerror-for-many-open","https://bugs.chromium.org/p/oss-fuzz/issues/detail?id=47024","https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2022/10/msg00001.html","https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202305-28","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20240315-0010/","https://bitbucket.org/snakeyaml/snakeyaml/issues/525/got-stackoverflowerror-for-many-open","https://bugs.chromium.org/p/oss-fuzz/issues/detail?id=47024","https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2022/10/msg00001.html","https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202305-28","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20240315-0010/"],"description":"Using snakeYAML to parse untrusted YAML files may be vulnerable to Denial of Service attacks (DOS).

is a fast compressor/decompressor for Java. Due to use of an unchecked chunk length, an unrecoverable fatal error can occur in versions prior to 1.1.10.1.\n\nThe code in the function hasNextChunk in the fileSnappyInputStream.java checks if a given stream has more chunks to read. It does that by attempting to read 4 bytes. If it wasn’t possible to read the 4 bytes, the function returns false. Otherwise, if 4 bytes were available, the code treats them as the length of the next chunk.\n\nIn the case that the `compressed` variable is null, a byte array is allocated with the size given by the input data. Since the code doesn’t test the legality of the `chunkSize` variable, it is possible to pass a negative number (such as 0xFFFFFFFF which is -1), which will cause the code to raise a `java.lang.NegativeArraySizeException` exception. A worse case would happen when passing a huge positive value (such as 0x7FFFFFFF), which would raise the fatal `java.lang.OutOfMemoryError` error.\n\nVersion 1.1.10.1 contains a patch for this issue.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":7.5,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"security-advisories@github.com","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":7.5,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2023-34455","epss":0.0033,"percentile":0.55461,"date":"2025-07-01"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-direct-match","matcher":"java-matcher","searchedBy":{"language":"java","namespace":"github:language:java","package":{"name":"snappy-java","version":"1.1.4"}},"found":{"versionConstraint":"<=1.1.10.0

This can be used to stop attackers from using the declared class property of Java enum objects to get access to the classloader. However this protection was not enabled by default. PropertyUtilsBean (and consequently BeanUtilsBean) now disallows declared class level property access by default.\n\n\n\n\n\nReleases 1.11.0 and 2.0.0-M2 address a potential security issue when accessing enum properties in an uncontrolled way. If an application using Commons BeanUtils passes property paths from an external source directly to the getProperty() method of PropertyUtilsBean, an attacker can access the enum’s class loader via the “declaredClass” property available on all Java “enum” objects. Accessing the enum’s “declaredClass” allows remote attackers to access the ClassLoader and execute arbitrary code. The same issue exists with PropertyUtilsBean.getNestedProperty().\nStarting in versions 1.11.0 and 2.0.0-M2 a special BeanIntrospector suppresses the “declaredClass” property. Note that this new BeanIntrospector is enabled by default, but you can disable it to regain the old behavior; see section 2.5 of the user's guide and the unit tests.\n\nThis issue affects Apache Commons BeanUtils 1.x before 1.11.0, and 2.x before 2.0.0-M2.Users of the artifact commons-beanutils:commons-beanutils\n\n 1.x are recommended to upgrade to version 1.11.0, which fixes the issue.\n\n\nUsers of the artifact org.apache.commons:commons-beanutils2\n\n 2.x are recommended to upgrade to version 2.0.0-M2, which fixes the issue.","cvss":[{"source":"134c704f-9b21-4f2e-91b3-4a467353bcc0","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":8.8,"exploitabilityScore":2.9,"impactScore":5.9},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2025-48734","epss":0.00215,"percentile":0.44313,"date":"2025-07-01"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-direct-match","matcher":"java-matcher","searchedBy":{"language":"java","namespace":"github:language:java","package":{"name":"commons-beanutils","version":"1.9.4"}},"found":{"versionConstraint":">=1.0,<=1.10.1 (unknown)","vulnerabilityID":"GHSA-wxr5-93ph-8wr9"},"fix":{"suggestedVersion":"1.11.0"}}],"artifact":{"id":"ManageEngine_ADManager_Plus_Common/AdventNet/ADManagerPlus/lib/commons-beanutils-1.9.4.jar","name":"commons-beanutils","version":"1.9.4","type":"java-archive","locations":null,"language":"java","licenses":[],"cpes":[],"purl":"pkg:maven/commons-beanutils/commons-beanutils@1.9.4","upstreams":[],"metadataType":"JavaMetadata","metadata":{"virtualPath":"","pomArtifactID":"commons-beanutils","pomGroupID":"commons-beanutils","manifestName":"","archiveDigests":null}}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"GHSA-4xc9-xhrj-v574","dataSource":"https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-4xc9-xhrj-v574","namespace":"github:language:javascript","severity":"High","urls":[],"description":"Prototype Pollution in lodash","cvss":[],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2018-16487","epss":0.00207,"percentile":0.43442,"date":"2025-07-01"}],"fix":{"versions":["4.17.11"],"state":"fixed"},"advisories":[],"risk":0.15524999999999997},"relatedVulnerabilities":[{"id":"CVE-2018-16487","dataSource":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-16487","namespace":"nvd:cpe","severity":"Medium","urls":["https://hackerone.com/reports/380873","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20190919-0004/","https://hackerone.com/reports/380873","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20190919-0004/"],"description":"A prototype pollution vulnerability was found in lodash <4.17.11 where the functions merge, mergeWith, and defaultsDeep can be tricked into adding or modifying properties of Object.prototype.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L","metrics":{"baseScore":5.6,"exploitabilityScore":2.3,"impactScore":3.4},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"2.0","vector":"AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P","metrics":{"baseScore":6.8,"exploitabilityScore":8.6,"impactScore":6.5},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2018-16487","epss":0.00207,"percentile":0.43442,"date":"2025-07-01"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-direct-match","matcher":"javascript-matcher","searchedBy":{"language":"javascript","namespace":"github:language:javascript","package":{"name":"lodash","version":"3.10.1"}},"found":{"versionConstraint":"<4.17.11 (unknown)","vulnerabilityID":"GHSA-4xc9-xhrj-v574"},"fix":{"suggestedVersion":"4.17.11"}}],"artifact":{"id":"ManageEngine_ADManager_Plus_Common/AdventNet/ADManagerPlus/webapps/adsm/rmpEmberApp/package-lock.json:lodash/3.10.1","name":"lodash","version":"3.10.1","type":"npm","locations":null,"language":"javascript","licenses":[],"cpes":[],"purl":"pkg:npm/lodash@3.10.1","upstreams":[]}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"CVE-2021-22144","dataSource":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-22144","namespace":"nvd:cpe","severity":"Medium","urls":["https://discuss.elastic.co/t/elasticsearch-7-13-3-and-6-8-17-security-update/278100","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20210827-0006/","https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpuapr2022.html","https://discuss.elastic.co/t/elasticsearch-7-13-3-and-6-8-17-security-update/278100","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20210827-0006/","https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpuapr2022.html"],"description":"In Elasticsearch versions before 7.13.3 and 6.8.17 an uncontrolled recursion vulnerability that could lead to a denial of service attack was identified in the Elasticsearch Grok parser.

Due to unchecked multiplications, an integer overflow may occur in versions prior to 1.1.10.1, causing an unrecoverable fatal error.\n\nThe function `compress(char[] input)` in the file `Snappy.java` receives an array of characters and compresses it. It does so by multiplying the length by 2 and passing it to the rawCompress` function.\n\nSince the length is not tested, the multiplication by two can cause an integer overflow and become negative. The rawCompress function then uses the received length and passes it to the natively compiled maxCompressedLength function, using the returned value to allocate a byte array.\n\nSince the maxCompressedLength function treats the length as an unsigned integer, it doesn’t care that it is negative, and it returns a valid value, which is casted to a signed integer by the Java engine. If the result is negative, a `java.lang.NegativeArraySizeException` exception will be raised while trying to allocate the array `buf`. On the other side, if the result is positive, the `buf` array will successfully be allocated, but its size might be too small to use for the compression, causing a fatal Access Violation error.\n\nThe same issue exists also when using the `compress` functions that receive double, float, int, long and short, each using a different multiplier that may cause the same issue. The issue most likely won’t occur when using a byte array, since creating a byte array of size 0x80000000 (or any other negative value) is impossible in the first place.\n\nVersion 1.1.10.1 contains a patch for this issue.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":7.5,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"security-advisories@github.com","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":5.9,"exploitabilityScore":2.3,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2023-34454","epss":0.00201,"percentile":0.42781,"date":"2025-07-01"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-direct-match","matcher":"java-matcher","searchedBy":{"language":"java","namespace":"github:language:java","package":{"name":"snappy-java","version":"1.1.4"}},"found":{"versionConstraint":"<=1.1.10.0 (unknown)","vulnerabilityID":"GHSA-fjpj-2g6w-x25r"},"fix":{"suggestedVersion":"1.1.10.1"}}],"artifact":{"id":"ManageEngine_ADManager_Plus_Common/AdventNet/ADManagerPlus/ES/plugins/search-guard-6/snappy-java-1.1.4.jar","name":"snappy-java","version":"1.1.4","type":"java-archive","locations":null,"language":"java","licenses":["The Apache Software License, Version 2.0"],"cpes":[],"purl":"pkg:maven/org.xerial.snappy/snappy-java@1.1.4","upstreams":[],"metadataType":"JavaMetadata","metadata":{"virtualPath":"","pomArtifactID":"snappy-java","pomGroupID":"org.xerial.snappy","manifestName":"","archiveDigests":null}}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"GHSA-xmc8-26q4-qjhx","dataSource":"https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-xmc8-26q4-qjhx","namespace":"github:language:java","severity":"High","urls":[],"description":"Denial of Service (DoS) in Jackson Dataformat CBOR","cvss":[{"type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":7.5,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2020-28491","epss":0.00134,"percentile":0.34318,"date":"2025-07-01"}],"fix":{"versions":["2.11.4"],"state":"fixed"},"advisories":[],"risk":0.1005},"relatedVulnerabilities":[{"id":"CVE-2020-28491","dataSource":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-28491","namespace":"nvd:cpe","severity":"High","urls":["https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-dataformats-binary/commit/de072d314af8f5f269c8abec6930652af67bc8e6","https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-dataformats-binary/issues/186","https://snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-JAVA-COMFASTERXMLJACKSONDATAFORMAT-1047329","https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpujul2022.html","https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-dataformats-binary/commit/de072d314af8f5f269c8abec6930652af67bc8e6","https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-dataformats-binary/issues/186","https://snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-JAVA-COMFASTERXMLJACKSONDATAFORMAT-1047329","https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpujul2022.html"],"description":"This affects the package com.fasterxml.jackson.dataformat:jackson-dataformat-cbor from 0 and before 2.11.4, from 2.12.0-rc1 and before 2.12.1.

In `@babel/traverse` prior to versions 7.23.2 and 8.0.0-alpha.4 and all versions of `babel-traverse`, using Babel to compile code that was specifically crafted by an attacker can lead to arbitrary code execution during compilation, when using plugins that rely on the `path.evaluate()`or `path.evaluateTruthy()` internal Babel methods. Known affected plugins are `@babel/plugin-transform-runtime`; `@babel/preset-env` when using its `useBuiltIns` option; and any \"polyfill provider\" plugin that depends on `@babel/helper-define-polyfill-provider`, such as `babel-plugin-polyfill-corejs3`, `babel-plugin-polyfill-corejs2`, `babel-plugin-polyfill-es-shims`, `babel-plugin-polyfill-regenerator`. No other plugins under the `@babel/` namespace are impacted, but third-party plugins might be. Users that only compile trusted code are not impacted. The vulnerability has been fixed in `@babel/traverse@7.23.2` and `@babel/traverse@8.0.0-alpha.4`. Those who cannot upgrade `@babel/traverse` and are using one of the affected packages mentioned above should upgrade them to their latest version to avoid triggering the vulnerable code path in affected `@babel/traverse` versions: `@babel/plugin-transform-runtime` v7.23.2, `@babel/preset-env` v7.23.2, `@babel/helper-define-polyfill-provider` v0.4.3, `babel-plugin-polyfill-corejs2` v0.4.6,

Versions 2.79.2, 3.29.5, and 4.22.4  contain a patch for the vulnerability.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":6.1,"exploitabilityScore":2.9,"impactScore":2.8},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"security-advisories@github.com","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":6.1,"exploitabilityScore":2.9,"impactScore":2.8},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2024-47068","epss":0.00051,"percentile":0.15723,"date":"2025-07-01"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-direct-match","matcher":"javascript-matcher","searchedBy":{"language":"javascript","namespace":"github:language:javascript","package":{"name":"rollup","version":"0.41.6"}},"found":{"versionConstraint":"<2.79.2 (unknown)","vulnerabilityID":"GHSA-gcx4-mw62-g8wm"},"fix":{"suggestedVersion":"2.79.2"}}],"artifact":{"id":"ManageEngine_ADManager_Plus_Common/AdventNet/ADManagerPlus/webapps/adsm/rmpEmberApp/package-lock.json:rollup/0.41.6","name":"rollup","version":"0.41.6","type":"npm","locations":null,"language":"javascript","licenses":[],"cpes":[],"purl":"pkg:npm/rollup@0.41.6","upstreams":[]}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"GHSA-6fx8-h7jm-663j","dataSource":"https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-6fx8-h7jm-663j","namespace":"github:language:javascript","severity":"Medium","urls":[],"description":"parse-uri Regular expression Denial of Service (ReDoS)","cvss":[],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2024-36751","epss":0.00067,"percentile":0.21242,"date":"2025-07-01"}],"fix":{"versions":[],"state":"not-fixed"},"advisories":[],"risk":0.0335},"relatedVulnerabilities":[{"id":"CVE-2024-36751","dataSource":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-36751","namespace":"nvd:cpe","severity":"Medium","urls":["https://gist.github.com/6en6ar/78168687da94e8aa2e0357f2456b0233","https://github.com/Kikobeats/parse-uri/issues/14"],"description":"An issue in parse-uri v1.0.9 allows attackers to cause a Regular expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) via a crafted URL.","cvss":[{"source":"134c704f-9b21-4f2e-91b3-4a467353bcc0","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":6.5,"exploitabilityScore":2.9,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2024-36751","epss":0.00067,"percentile":0.21242,"date":"2025-07-01"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-direct-match","matcher":"javascript-matcher","searchedBy":{"language":"javascript","namespace":"github:language:javascript","package":{"name":"parseuri","version":"0.0.6"}},"found":{"versionConstraint":"<2.0.0 (unknown)","vulnerabilityID":"GHSA-6fx8-h7jm-663j"}}],"artifact":{"id":"ManageEngine_ADManager_Plus_Common/AdventNet/ADManagerPlus/webapps/adsm/rmpEmberApp/package-lock.json:parseuri/0.0.6","name":"parseuri","version":"0.0.6","type":"npm","locations":null,"language":"javascript","licenses":[],"cpes":[],"purl":"pkg:npm/parseuri@0.0.6","upstreams":[]}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"GHSA-gmg8-593g-7mv3","dataSource":"https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-gmg8-593g-7mv3","namespace":"github:language:java","severity":"Medium","urls":[],"description":"Apache POI OOXML Vulnerable to Improper Input Validation in OOXML File Parsing","cvss":[{"type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":5.3,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":1.5},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2025-31672","epss":0.00064,"percentile":0.20335,"date":"2025-07-01"}],"fix":{"versions":["5.4.0"],"state":"fixed"},"advisories":[],"risk":0.03296},"relatedVulnerabilities":[{"id":"CVE-2025-31672","dataSource":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-31672","namespace":"nvd:cpe","severity":"Medium","urls":["https://bz.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=69620","https://lists.apache.org/thread/k14w8vcjqy4h34hh5kzldko78kpylkq5","http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2025/04/08/2","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20250523-0004/"],"description":"Improper Input Validation vulnerability in Apache POI.

temp directory creation vulnerability exists in all versions of Guava, allowing an attacker with access to the machine to potentially access data in a temporary directory created by the Guava API com.google.common.io.Files.createTempDir(). By default, on unix-like systems, the created directory is world-readable (readable by an attacker with access to the system). The method in question has been marked @Deprecated in versions 30.0 and later and should not be used. For Android developers, we recommend choosing a temporary directory API provided by Android, such as context.getCacheDir(). For other Java developers, we recommend migrating to the Java 7 API java.nio.file.Files.createTempDirectory() which explicitly configures permissions of 700, or configuring the Java runtime's java.io.tmpdir system property to point to a location whose permissions are appropriately configured.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":3.3,"exploitabilityScore":1.9,"impactScore":1.5},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"2.0","vector":"AV:L/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:N/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":2.1,"exploitabilityScore":4,"impactScore":2.9},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"cve-coordination@google.com","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":3.3,"exploitabilityScore":1.9,"impactScore":1.5},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2020-8908","epss":0.00008,"percentile":0.00501,"date":"2025-07-01"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-direct-match","matcher":"java-matcher","searchedBy":{"language":"java","namespace":"github:language:java","package":{"name":"guava","version":"25.1-jre"}},"found":{"versionConstraint":"<32.0.0-android
