## Vulnerability Details


### pkg:pypi/uv@0.7.15
Python libuv CFFI Bindings
#### Vulnerabilities


Title: **[CVE-2025-54368] CWE-20: Improper Input Validation**<br>
Severity: **MODERATE**<br>

[Reference Documentation](https://ossindex.sonatype.org/vulnerability/CVE-2025-54368?component-type=pypi&component-name=uv&utm_source=go-resty&utm_medium=integration&utm_content=2.15.2)

uv is a Python package and project manager written in Rust. In versions 0.8.5 and earlier, remote ZIP archives were handled in a streamwise fashion, and file entries were not reconciled against the archive's central directory. An attacker could contrive a ZIP archive that would extract with legitimate contents on some package installers, and malicious contents on others due to multiple local file entries. An attacker could  also contrive a "stacked" ZIP input with multiple internal ZIPs, which would be handled differently by different package installers. The attacker could choose which installer to target in both scenarios. This issue is fixed in version 0.8.6. To work around this issue, users may choose to set UV_INSECURE_NO_ZIP_VALIDATION=1 to revert to the previous behavior.

A vulnerability in the `preprocess_string()` function of the `transformers.testing_utils` module in huggingface/transformers version v4.48.3 allows for a Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) attack. The regular expression used to process code blocks in docstrings contains nested quantifiers, leading to exponential backtracking when processing input with a large number of newline characters. An attacker can exploit this by providing a specially crafted payload, causing high CPU usage and potential application downtime, effectively resulting in a Denial of Service (DoS) scenario.

Sonatype's research suggests that this CVE's details differ from those defined at NVD. See https://ossindex.sonatype.org/vulnerability/CVE-2025-2099 for details

Title: **[CVE-2025-5197] CWE-1333**<br>
Severity: **HIGH**<br>

[Reference Documentation](https://ossindex.sonatype.org/vulnerability/CVE-2025-5197?component-type=pypi&component-name=transformers&utm_source=go-resty&utm_medium=integration&utm_content=2.15.2)

A Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) vulnerability exists in the Hugging Face Transformers library, specifically in the `convert_tf_weight_name_to_pt_weight_name()` function. This function, responsible for converting TensorFlow weight names to PyTorch format, uses a regex pattern `/[^/]*___([^/]*)/` that can be exploited to cause excessive CPU consumption through crafted input strings due to catastrophic backtracking. The vulnerability affects versions up to 4.51.3 and is fixed in version 4.53.0. This issue can lead to service disruption, resource exhaustion, and potential API service vulnerabilities, impacting model conversion processes between TensorFlow and PyTorch formats.

### pkg:pypi/pip@25.1.1
The PyPA recommended tool for installing Python packages.
#### Vulnerabilities


Title: **[CVE-2018-20225] CWE-20: Improper Input Validation**<br>
Severity: **HIGH**<br>

[Reference Documentation](https://ossindex.sonatype.org/vulnerability/CVE-2018-20225?component-type=pypi&component-name=pip&utm_source=go-resty&utm_medium=integration&utm_content=2.15.2)

An issue was discovered in pip (all versions) because it installs the version with the highest version number, even if the user had intended to obtain a private package from a private index. This only affects use of the --extra-index-url option, and exploitation requires that the package does not already exist in the public index (and thus the attacker can put the package there with an arbitrary version number). NOTE: it has been reported that this is intended functionality and the user is responsible for using --extra-index-url securely

Sonatype's research suggests that this CVE's details differ from those defined at NVD. See https://ossindex.sonatype.org/vulnerability/CVE-2018-20225 for details
