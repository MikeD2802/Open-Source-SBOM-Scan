This is achieved by stripping the absolute path root from any absolute file paths contained in a tar file. For example `/home/user/.bashrc` would turn into `home/user/.bashrc`. This logic was insufficient when file paths contained repeated path roots such as `////home/user/.bashrc`. `node-tar` would only strip a single path root from such paths. When given an absolute file path with repeating path roots, the resulting path (e.g. `///home/user/.bashrc`) would still resolve to an absolute path, thus allowing arbitrary file creation and overwrite. This issue was addressed in releases 3.2.2, 4.4.14, 5.0.6 and 6.1.1. Users may work around this vulnerability without upgrading by creating a custom `onentry` method which sanitizes the `entry.path` or a `filter` method which removes entries with absolute paths. See referenced GitHub Advisory for details. Be aware of CVE-2021-32803 which fixes a similar bug in later versions of tar.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":8.1,"exploitabilityScore":2.9,"impactScore":5.2},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"2.0","vector":"AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:N/I:P/A:P","metrics":{"baseScore":5.8,"exploitabilityScore":8.6,"impactScore":5},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"security-advisories@github.com","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":8.2,"exploitabilityScore":1.9,"impactScore":5.8},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2021-32804","epss":0.86816,"percentile":0.99393,"date":"2025-07-02"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-direct-match","matcher":"javascript-matcher","searchedBy":{"language":"javascript","namespace":"github:language:javascript","package":{"name":"tar","version":"6.0.2"}},"found":{"vulnerabilityID":"GHSA-3jfq-g458-7qm9","versionConstraint":">=6.0.0,<6.1.1

The `parse` method of the JSON5 library before and including versions 1.0.1 and 2.2.1 does not restrict parsing of keys named `__proto__`, allowing specially crafted strings to pollute the prototype of the resulting object. This vulnerability pollutes the prototype of the object returned by `JSON5.parse` and not the global Object prototype, which is the commonly understood definition of Prototype Pollution. However, polluting the prototype of a single object can have significant security impact for an application if the object is later used in trusted operations. This vulnerability could allow an attacker to set arbitrary and unexpected keys on the object returned from `JSON5.parse`. The actual impact will depend on how applications utilize the returned object and how they filter unwanted keys, but could include denial of service, cross-site scripting, elevation of privilege, and in extreme cases, remote code execution. `JSON5.parse` should restrict parsing of `__proto__` keys when parsing JSON strings to objects. As a point of reference, the `JSON.parse` method included in JavaScript ignores `__proto__` keys. Simply changing `JSON5.parse` to `JSON.parse` in the examples above mitigates this vulnerability. This vulnerability is patched in json5 versions 1.0.2, 2.2.2, and later.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":8.8,"exploitabilityScore":2.9,"impactScore":5.9},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"security-advisories@github.com","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:L/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":7.1,"exploitabilityScore":1.7,"impactScore":5.5},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2022-46175","epss":0.4532,"percentile":0.97472,"date":"2025-07-02"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-direct-match","matcher":"javascript-matcher","searchedBy":{"language":"javascript","namespace":"github:language:javascript","package":{"name":"json5","version":"2.1.3"}},"found":{"vulnerabilityID":"GHSA-9c47-m6qq-7p4h","versionConstraint":">=2.0.0,<2.2.2 (unknown)"},"fix":{"suggestedVersion":"2.2.2"}}],"artifact":{"id":"pkg:npm/json5@2.1.3","name":"json5","version":"2.1.3","type":"npm","locations":null,"language":"javascript","licenses":["MIT"],"cpes":[],"purl":"pkg:npm/json5@2.1.3","upstreams":[]}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"GHSA-hrpp-h998-j3pp","dataSource":"https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-hrpp-h998-j3pp","namespace":"github:language:javascript","severity":"High","urls":[],"description":"qs vulnerable to Prototype Pollution","cvss":[{"type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":7.5,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2022-24999","epss":0.05645,"percentile":0.89956,"date":"2025-07-02"}],"fix":{"versions":["6.5.3"],"state":"fixed"},"advisories":[],"risk":4.23375},"relatedVulnerabilities":[{"id":"CVE-2022-24999","dataSource":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-24999","namespace":"nvd:cpe","severity":"High","urls":["https://github.com/expressjs/express/releases/tag/4.17.3","https://github.com/ljharb/qs/pull/428","https://github.com/n8tz/CVE-2022-24999","https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2023/01/msg00039.html","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20230908-0005/","https://github.com/expressjs/express/releases/tag/4.17.3","https://github.com/ljharb/qs/pull/428","https://github.com/n8tz/CVE-2022-24999","https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2023/01/msg00039.html","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20230908-0005/"],"description":"qs before 6.10.3, as used in Express before 4.17.3 and other products, allows attackers to cause a Node process hang for an Express application because an __ proto__ key can be used.

npm package \"tar\" (aka node-tar) before versions 4.4.18, 5.0.10, and 6.1.9 has an arbitrary file creation/overwrite and arbitrary code execution vulnerability. node-tar aims to guarantee that any file whose location would be outside of the extraction target directory is not extracted. This is, in part, accomplished by sanitizing absolute paths of entries within the archive, skipping archive entries that contain `..` path portions, and resolving the sanitized paths against the extraction target directory. This logic was insufficient on Windows systems when extracting tar files that contained a path that was not an absolute path, but specified a drive letter different from the extraction target, such as `C:some\\path`. If the drive letter does not match the extraction target, for example `D:\\extraction\\dir`, then the result of `path.resolve(extractionDirectory, entryPath)` would resolve against the current working directory on the `C:` drive, rather than the extraction target directory. Additionally, a `..` portion of the path could occur immediately after the drive letter, such as `C:../foo`, and was not properly sanitized by the logic that checked for `..` within the normalized and split portions of the path. This only affects users of `node-tar` on Windows systems. These issues were addressed in releases 4.4.18, 5.0.10 and 6.1.9. The v3 branch of node-tar has been deprecated and did not receive patches for these issues. If you are still using a v3 release we recommend you update to a more recent version of node-tar. There is no reasonable way to work around this issue without performing the same path normalization procedures that node-tar now does. Users are encouraged to upgrade to the latest patched versions of node-tar, rather than attempt to sanitize paths themselves.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":8.6,"exploitabilityScore":1.9,"impactScore":6.1},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"2.0","vector":"AV:L/AC:M/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P","metrics":{"baseScore":4.4,"exploitabilityScore":3.4,"impactScore":6.5},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"security-advisories@github.com","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":8.2,"exploitabilityScore":1.9,"impactScore":5.8},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2021-37713","epss":0.00938,"percentile":0.75287,"date":"2025-07-02"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-direct-match","matcher":"javascript-matcher","searchedBy":{"language":"javascript","namespace":"github:language:javascript","package":{"name":"tar","version":"6.0.2"}},"found":{"vulnerabilityID":"GHSA-5955-9wpr-37jh","versionConstraint":">=6.0.0,<6.1.9

is a javascript URL mutation library (npm package urijs). In URI.js before version 1.19.4, the hostname can be spoofed by using a backslash (`\\`) character followed by an at (`@`) character. If the hostname is used in security decisions, the decision may be incorrect. Depending on library usage and attacker intent, impacts may include allow/block list bypasses, SSRF attacks, open redirects, or other undesired behavior. For example the URL `https://expected-example.com\\@observed-example.com` will incorrectly return `observed-example.com` if using an affected version. Patched versions correctly return `expected-example.com`. Patched versions match the behavior of other parsers which implement the WHATWG URL specification, including web browsers and Node's built-in URL class.

This is, in part, achieved by ensuring that extracted directories are not symlinks. Additionally, in order to prevent unnecessary `stat` calls to determine whether a given path is a directory, paths are cached when directories are created. This logic was insufficient when extracting tar files that contained both a directory and a symlink with the same name as the directory. This order of operations resulted in the directory being created and added to the `node-tar` directory cache. When a directory is present in the directory cache, subsequent calls to mkdir for that directory are skipped. However, this is also where `node-tar` checks for symlinks occur. By first creating a directory, and then replacing that directory with a symlink, it was thus possible to bypass `node-tar` symlink checks on directories, essentially allowing an untrusted tar file to symlink into an arbitrary location and subsequently extracting arbitrary files into that location, thus allowing arbitrary file creation and overwrite. This issue was addressed in releases 3.2.3, 4.4.15, 5.0.7 and 6.1.2.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":8.1,"exploitabilityScore":2.9,"impactScore":5.2},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"2.0","vector":"AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:N/I:P/A:P","metrics":{"baseScore":5.8,"exploitabilityScore":8.6,"impactScore":5},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"security-advisories@github.com","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":8.2,"exploitabilityScore":1.9,"impactScore":5.8},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2021-32803","epss":0.00191,"percentile":0.4164,"date":"2025-07-02"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-direct-match","matcher":"javascript-matcher","searchedBy":{"language":"javascript","namespace":"github:language:javascript","package":{"name":"tar","version":"6.0.2"}},"found":{"vulnerabilityID":"GHSA-r628-mhmh-qjhw","versionConstraint":">=6.0.0,<6.1.2 (unknown)"},"fix":{"suggestedVersion":"6.1.2"}}],"artifact":{"id":"pkg:npm/tar@6.0.2","name":"tar","version":"6.0.2","type":"npm","locations":null,"language":"javascript","licenses":["ISC"],"cpes":[],"purl":"pkg:npm/tar@6.0.2","upstreams":[]}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"GHSA-593f-38f6-jp5m","dataSource":"https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-593f-38f6-jp5m","namespace":"github:language:javascript","severity":"Critical","urls":[],"description":"Inefficient Regular Expression Complexity in koa","cvss":[],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2025-25200","epss":0.00152,"percentile":0.36978,"date":"2025-07-02"}],"fix":{"versions":["2.15.4"],"state":"fixed"},"advisories":[],"risk":0.1368},"relatedVulnerabilities":[{"id":"CVE-2025-25200","dataSource":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-25200","namespace":"nvd:cpe","severity":"Critical","urls":["https://github.com/koajs/koa/blob/master/lib/request.js#L259","https://github.com/koajs/koa/blob/master/lib/request.js#L404","https://github.com/koajs/koa/commit/5054af6e31ffd451a4151a1fe144cef6e5d0d83c","https://github.com/koajs/koa/commit/5f294bb1c7c8d9c61904378d250439a321bffd32","https://github.com/koajs/koa/commit/93fe903fc966635a991bcf890cfc3427d33a1a08","https://github.com/koajs/koa/releases/tag/2.15.4","https://github.com/koajs/koa/security/advisories/GHSA-593f-38f6-jp5m"],"description":"Koa is expressive middleware for Node.js using ES2017 async functions.

In vulnerable versions of ws, the issue can be mitigated by reducing the maximum allowed length of the request headers using the [`--max-http-header-size=size`](https://nodejs.org/api/cli.html#cli_max_http_header_size_size) and/or the [`maxHeaderSize`](https://nodejs.org/api/http.html#http_http_createserver_options_requestlistener) options.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L","metrics":{"baseScore":5.3,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":1.5},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"2.0","vector":"AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:P","metrics":{"baseScore":5,"exploitabilityScore":10,"impactScore":2.9},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"security-advisories@github.com","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L","metrics":{"baseScore":5.3,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":1.5},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2021-32640","epss":0.00257,"percentile":0.49142,"date":"2025-07-02"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-direct-match","matcher":"javascript-matcher","searchedBy":{"language":"javascript","namespace":"github:language:javascript","package":{"name":"ws","version":"5.2.2"}},"found":{"vulnerabilityID":"GHSA-6fc8-4gx4-v693","versionConstraint":">=5.0.0,<5.2.3 (unknown)"},"fix":{"suggestedVersion":"5.2.3"}}],"artifact":{"id":"pkg:npm/ws@5.2.2","name":"ws","version":"5.2.2","type":"npm","locations":null,"language":"javascript","licenses":["MIT"],"cpes":[],"purl":"pkg:npm/ws@5.2.2","upstreams":[]}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"GHSA-3xgq-45jj-v275","dataSource":"https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-3xgq-45jj-v275","namespace":"github:language:javascript","severity":"High","urls":[],"description":"Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) in cross-spawn","cvss":[{"type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":7.5,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2024-21538","epss":0.0017,"percentile":0.39053,"date":"2025-07-02"}],"fix":{"versions":["6.0.6"],"state":"fixed"},"advisories":[],"risk":0.12749999999999997},"relatedVulnerabilities":[{"id":"CVE-2024-21538","dataSource":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-21538","namespace":"nvd:cpe","severity":"High","urls":["https://github.com/moxystudio/node-cross-spawn/commit/5ff3a07d9add449021d806e45c4168203aa833ff","https://github.com/moxystudio/node-cross-spawn/commit/640d391fde65388548601d95abedccc12943374f","https://github.com/moxystudio/node-cross-spawn/pull/160","https://security.snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-JAVA-ORGWEBJARSNPM-8366349","https://security.snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-JS-CROSSSPAWN-8303230"],"description":"Versions of the package cross-spawn before 6.0.6, from 7.0.0 and before 7.0.5 are vulnerable to Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) due to improper input sanitization.

By passing a malicious payload, the pattern matching will keep backtracking to the input while it doesn't find the closing bracket. As the input size increases, the consumption time will also increase until it causes the application to hang or slow down. There was a merged fix but further testing shows the issue persists.

In `@babel/traverse` prior to versions 7.23.2 and 8.0.0-alpha.4 and all versions of `babel-traverse`, using Babel to compile code that was specifically crafted by an attacker can lead to arbitrary code execution during compilation, when using plugins that rely on the `path.evaluate()`or `path.evaluateTruthy()` internal Babel methods. Known affected plugins are `@babel/plugin-transform-runtime`; `@babel/preset-env` when using its `useBuiltIns` option; and any \"polyfill provider\" plugin that depends on `@babel/helper-define-polyfill-provider`, such as `babel-plugin-polyfill-corejs3`, `babel-plugin-polyfill-corejs2`, `babel-plugin-polyfill-es-shims`, `babel-plugin-polyfill-regenerator`.

is a JavaScript implementation of the OpenPGP protocol. In affected versions OpenPGP Cleartext Signed Messages are cryptographically signed messages where the signed text is readable without special tools. These messages typically contain a \"Hash: ...\" header declaring the hash algorithm used to compute the signature digest. OpenPGP.js up to v5.9.0 ignored any data preceding the \"Hash: ...\" texts when verifying the signature. As a result, malicious parties could add arbitrary text to a third-party Cleartext Signed Message, to lead the victim to believe that the arbitrary text was signed. A user or application is vulnerable to said attack vector if it verifies the CleartextMessage by only checking the returned `verified` property, discarding the associated `data` information, and instead _visually trusting_ the contents of the original message. Since `verificationResult.data` would always contain the actual signed data, users and apps that check this information are not vulnerable. Similarly, given a CleartextMessage object, retrieving the data using `getText()` or the `text` field returns only the contents that are considered when verifying the signature. Finally, re-armoring a CleartextMessage object (using `armor()` will also result in a \"sanitised\" version, with the extraneous text being removed. This issue has been addressed in version 5.10.1 (current stable version) which will reject messages when calling `openpgp.readCleartextMessage()` and in version 4.10.11 (legacy version) which will will reject messages when calling `openpgp.cleartext.readArmored()`. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should check the contents of `verificationResult.data` to see what data was actually signed, rather than visually trusting the contents of the armored message.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":4.3,"exploitabilityScore":2.9,"impactScore":1.5},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"security-advisories@github.com","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":4.3,"exploitabilityScore":2.9,"impactScore":1.5},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2023-41037","epss":0.00076,"percentile":0.23552,"date":"2025-07-02"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-direct-match","matcher":"javascript-matcher","searchedBy":{"language":"javascript","namespace":"github:language:javascript","package":{"name":"openpgp","version":"4.10.7"}},"found":{"vulnerabilityID":"GHSA-ch3c-v47x-4pgp","versionConstraint":"<4.10.11 (unknown)"},"fix":{"suggestedVersion":"4.10.11"}}],"artifact":{"id":"pkg:npm/openpgp@4.10.7","name":"openpgp","version":"4.10.7","type":"npm","locations":null,"language":"javascript","licenses":["LGPL-3.0+"],"cpes":[],"purl":"pkg:npm/openpgp@4.10.7","upstreams":[]}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"GHSA-gxpj-cx7g-858c","dataSource":"https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-gxpj-cx7g-858c","namespace":"github:language:javascript","severity":"Low","urls":[],"description":"Regular Expression Denial of Service in debug","cvss":[{"type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L","metrics":{"baseScore":3.7,"exploitabilityScore":2.3,"impactScore":1.5},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2017-16137","epss":0.00097,"percentile":0.28035,"date":"2025-07-02"}],"fix":{"versions":["3.2.7"],"state":"fixed"},"advisories":[],"risk":0.032494999999999996},"relatedVulnerabilities":[{"id":"CVE-2017-16137","dataSource":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2017-16137","namespace":"nvd:cpe","severity":"Medium","urls":["https://github.com/visionmedia/debug/issues/501","https://github.com/visionmedia/debug/pull/504","https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/r8ba4c628fba7181af58817d452119481adce4ba92e889c643e4c7dd3%40%3Ccommits.netbeans.apache.org%3E","https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/rb5ac16fad337d1f3bb7079549f97d8166d0ef3082629417c39f12d63%40%3Cnotifications.netbeans.apache.org%3E","https://nodesecurity.io/advisories/534","https://github.com/visionmedia/debug/issues/501","https://github.com/visionmedia/debug/pull/504","https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/r8ba4c628fba7181af58817d452119481adce4ba92e889c643e4c7dd3%40%3Ccommits.netbeans.apache.org%3E","https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/rb5ac16fad337d1f3bb7079549f97d8166d0ef3082629417c39f12d63%40%3Cnotifications.netbeans.apache.org%3E","https://nodesecurity.io/advisories/534"],"description":"The debug module is vulnerable to regular expression denial of service when untrusted user input is passed into the o formatter.

This is, in part, achieved by ensuring that extracted directories are not symlinks. Additionally, in order to prevent unnecessary stat calls to determine whether a given path is a directory, paths are cached when directories are created. This logic was insufficient when extracting tar files that contained both a directory and a symlink with names containing unicode values that normalized to the same value. Additionally, on Windows systems, long path portions would resolve to the same file system entities as their 8.3 \"short path\" counterparts. A specially crafted tar archive could thus include a directory with one form of the path, followed by a symbolic link with a different string that resolves to the same file system entity, followed by a file using the first form. By first creating a directory, and then replacing that directory with a symlink that had a different apparent name that resolved to the same entry in the filesystem, it was thus possible to bypass node-tar symlink checks on directories, essentially allowing an untrusted tar file to symlink into an arbitrary location and subsequently extracting arbitrary files into that location, thus allowing arbitrary file creation and overwrite. These issues were addressed in releases 4.4.18, 5.0.10 and 6.1.9. The v3 branch of node-tar has been deprecated and did not receive patches for these issues. If you are still using a v3 release we recommend you update to a more recent version of node-tar. If this is not possible, a workaround is available in the referenced GHSA-qq89-hq3f-393p.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":8.6,"exploitabilityScore":1.9,"impactScore":6.1},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"2.0","vector":"AV:L/AC:M/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P","metrics":{"baseScore":4.4,"exploitabilityScore":3.4,"impactScore":6.5},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"security-advisories@github.com","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":8.2,"exploitabilityScore":1.9,"impactScore":5.8},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2021-37712","epss":0.00021,"percentile":0.0406,"date":"2025-07-02"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-direct-match","matcher":"javascript-matcher","searchedBy":{"language":"javascript","namespace":"github:language:javascript","package":{"name":"tar","version":"6.0.2"}},"found":{"vulnerabilityID":"GHSA-qq89-hq3f-393p","versionConstraint":">=6.0.0,<6.1.9 (unknown)"},"fix":{"suggestedVersion":"6.1.9"}}],"artifact":{"id":"pkg:npm/tar@6.0.2","name":"tar","version":"6.0.2","type":"npm","locations":null,"language":"javascript","licenses":["ISC"],"cpes":[],"purl":"pkg:npm/tar@6.0.2","upstreams":[]}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"GHSA-v6h2-p8h4-qcjw","dataSource":"https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-v6h2-p8h4-qcjw","namespace":"github:language:javascript","severity":"Low","urls":[],"description":"brace-expansion Regular Expression Denial of Service vulnerability","cvss":[{"type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L","metrics":{"baseScore":3.1,"exploitabilityScore":1.7,"impactScore":1.5},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2025-5889","epss":0.00052,"percentile":0.16244,"date":"2025-07-02"}],"fix":{"versions":["1.1.12"],"state":"fixed"},"advisories":[],"risk":0.01586},"relatedVulnerabilities":[{"id":"CVE-2025-5889","dataSource":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-5889","namespace":"nvd:cpe","severity":"Low","urls":["https://gist.github.com/mmmsssttt404/37a40ce7d6e5ca604858fe30814d9466","https://github.com/juliangruber/brace-expansion/pull/65/commits/a5b98a4f30d7813266b221435e1eaaf25a1b0ac5","https://github.com/juliangruber/brace-expansion/releases/tag/v4.0.1","https://vuldb.com/?ctiid.311660","https://vuldb.com/?id.311660","https://vuldb.com/?submit.585717"],"description":"A vulnerability was found in juliangruber brace-expansion up to 1.1.11/2.0.1/3.0.0/4.0.0.

This is, in part, achieved by ensuring that extracted directories are not symlinks. Additionally, in order to prevent unnecessary stat calls to determine whether a given path is a directory, paths are cached when directories are created. This logic was insufficient when extracting tar files that contained both a directory and a symlink with the same name as the directory, where the symlink and directory names in the archive entry used backslashes as a path separator on posix systems. The cache checking logic used both `\\` and `/` characters as path separators, however `\\` is a valid filename character on posix systems. By first creating a directory, and then replacing that directory with a symlink, it was thus possible to bypass node-tar symlink checks on directories, essentially allowing an untrusted tar file to symlink into an arbitrary location and subsequently extracting arbitrary files into that location, thus allowing arbitrary file creation and overwrite. Additionally, a similar confusion could arise on case-insensitive filesystems. If a tar archive contained a directory at `FOO`, followed by a symbolic link named `foo`, then on case-insensitive file systems, the creation of the symbolic link would remove the directory from the filesystem, but _not_ from the internal directory cache, as it would not be treated as a cache hit. A subsequent file entry within the `FOO` directory would then be placed in the target of the symbolic link, thinking that the directory had already been created. These issues were addressed in releases 4.4.16, 5.0.8 and 6.1.7. The v3 branch of node-tar has been deprecated and did not receive patches for these issues. If you are still using a v3 release we recommend you update to a more recent version of node-tar. If this is not possible, a workaround is available in the referenced GHSA-9r2w-394v-53qc.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":8.6,"exploitabilityScore":1.9,"impactScore":6.1},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"2.0","vector":"AV:L/AC:M/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P","metrics":{"baseScore":4.4,"exploitabilityScore":3.4,"impactScore":6.5},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"security-advisories@github.com","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":8.2,"exploitabilityScore":1.9,"impactScore":5.8},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2021-37701","epss":0.00015,"percentile":0.02069,"date":"2025-07-02"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-direct-match","matcher":"javascript-matcher","searchedBy":{"language":"javascript","namespace":"github:language:javascript","package":{"name":"tar","version":"6.0.2"}},"found":{"vulnerabilityID":"GHSA-9r2w-394v-53qc","versionConstraint":">=6.0.0,<6.1.7 (unknown)"},"fix":{"suggestedVersion":"6.1.7"}}],"artifact":{"id":"pkg:npm/tar@6.0.2","name":"tar","version":"6.0.2","type":"npm","locations":null,"language":"javascript","licenses":["ISC"],"cpes":[],"purl":"pkg:npm/tar@6.0.2","upstreams":[]}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"GHSA-mqm9-c95h-x2p6","dataSource":"https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-mqm9-c95h-x2p6","namespace":"github:language:javascript","severity":"Low","urls":[],"description":"AngularJS allows attackers to bypass common image source restrictions","cvss":[{"type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:L","metrics":{"baseScore":4.8,"exploitabilityScore":2.3,"impactScore":2.6},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2024-8373","epss":0.00025,"percentile":0.0525,"date":"2025-07-02"}],"fix":{"versions":[],"state":"not-fixed"},"advisories":[],"risk":0.009750000000000002},"relatedVulnerabilities":[{"id":"CVE-2024-8373","dataSource":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-8373","namespace":"nvd:cpe","severity":"Medium","urls":["https://codepen.io/herodevs/full/bGPQgMp/8da9ce87e99403ee13a295c305ebfa0b","https://www.herodevs.com/vulnerability-directory/cve-2024-8373","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20241122-0003/"],"description":"Improper sanitization of the value of the [srcset] attribute in <source> HTML elements in AngularJS allows attackers to bypass common image source restrictions, which can also lead to a form of  Content Spoofing https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/Content_Spoofing .\n\nThis issue affects all versions of AngularJS.\n\nNote:\nThe AngularJS project is End-of-Life and will not receive any updates to address this issue.
