Prior to version 3.12.14, the Python parser is vulnerable to a request smuggling vulnerability due to not parsing trailer sections of an HTTP request. If a pure Python version of aiohttp is installed (i.e. without the usual C extensions) or AIOHTTP_NO_EXTENSIONS is enabled, then an attacker may be able to execute a request smuggling attack to bypass certain firewalls or proxy protections. Version 3.12.14 contains a patch for this issue.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":7.5,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"security-advisories@github.com","type":"Secondary","version":"4.0","vector":"CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:P/PR:N/UI:N/VC:N/VI:L/VA:N/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N/E:U/CR:X/IR:X/AR:X/MAV:X/MAC:X/MAT:X/MPR:X/MUI:X/MVC:X/MVI:X/MVA:X/MSC:X/MSI:X/MSA:X/S:X/AU:X/R:X/V:X/RE:X/U:X","metrics":{"baseScore":1.7},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2025-53643","epss":0.00044,"percentile":0.12424,"date":"2025-09-02"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-direct-match","matcher":"python-matcher","searchedBy":{"language":"python","namespace":"github:language:python","package":{"name":"aiohttp","version":"3.12.13"}},"found":{"vulnerabilityID":"GHSA-9548-qrrj-x5pj","versionConstraint":"<3.12.14 (python)"},"fix":{"suggestedVersion":"3.12.14"}}],"artifact":{"id":"pypi-aiohttp-3.12.13-75c946","name":"aiohttp","version":"3.12.13","type":"python","locations":null,"language":"python","licenses":["Apache-2.0"],"cpes":[],"purl":"pkg:pypi/aiohttp@3.12.13","upstreams":[]}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"GHSA-xg8h-j46f-w952","dataSource":"https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-xg8h-j46f-w952","namespace":"github:language:python","severity":"High","urls":[],"description":"Pillow vulnerability can cause write buffer overflow on BCn encoding","cvss":[{"type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":7.1,"exploitabilityScore":1.9,"impactScore":5.2},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2025-48379","epss":0.00015,"percentile":0.02042,"date":"2025-09-02"}],"fix":{"versions":["11.3.0"],"state":"fixed","available":[{"version":"11.3.0","date":"2025-07-02","kind":"first-observed"}]},"advisories":[],"risk":0.01095},"relatedVulnerabilities":[{"id":"CVE-2025-48379","dataSource":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-48379","namespace":"nvd:cpe","severity":"High","urls":["https://github.com/python-pillow/Pillow/commit/ef98b3510e3e4f14b547762764813d7e5ca3c5a4","https://github.com/python-pillow/Pillow/pull/9041","https://github.com/python-pillow/Pillow/releases/tag/11.3.0","https://github.com/python-pillow/Pillow/security/advisories/GHSA-xg8h-j46f-w952"],"description":"Pillow is a Python imaging library.
